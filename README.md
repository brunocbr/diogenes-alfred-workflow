# diogenes-alfred-workflow

This workflow allows you to browse works and passages from Diogenes ancient texts databases.

It requires Diogenes to be installed and running. Download it from https://community.dur.ac.uk/p.j.heslin/Software/Diogenes/.

If Diogenes server is running in a different location, please open the "Configure workflow and variables" icon (on the top right of the workflow area), and change the variable "base_url".

You may also choose which databases to enable (TLG and the PHI Latin Corpus come enabled by default).
